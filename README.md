##Resources
 * [Animated Skills Bar jQuery Plugin](https://github.com/JustParsa/animated-skills-bar-jquery-css3)
  * This resource provided the information to use the skills bar plugin located in my "Skills" section. I followed their installation and used their CSS and jQuery code in my main.js file and their skill-bar.css file in my root directory. This plugin creates skills bars that move to their stated percentage to show my the depth I have in certain skills.

 * [Tabslet jQuery Plugin](http://vdw.github.io/Tabslet/)
  * This plugin can be found in my "Work Experience" section. This plug in sets up a section of tabs with a hover effect. The tabs show different work experience information when switched between the different jobs as the tab titles. I used the CSS and jQuery code from this site in my main.css and main.js files.
 
 * [jQuery Tutorial for Events](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/click-once-and-unbind/)
  * This site walked me through how to make sure that my event only happens once when a button is clicked. I have a contact button that displays a div when clicked, and I used this tutorial as a guide to implement the .one() in my custom code.

 * [jQuery Hover method tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/event_hover.asp)
  * This resource described how to set up a hover on and off method with jQuery. I used their setup, but I integrated my own selectors and .css() effects.

##Deductions
 * I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus. 

###Comments
 * I really enjoyed this project because I loved using jQuery more than JavaScript.
